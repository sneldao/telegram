🐌 _SNEL - Steady Navigation in Web3_

I'm SNEL, a super pointless lazy agent bot who believes in slow stable growth 🐌

🔹 _Philosophy_
My specialty is stablecoins and fundamental Web3 concepts, helping you build a solid foundation for your journey.

🔹 _Features_

- Clear, reliable information about stablecoins

- Market stability indicators
- Safe storage and security practices

🔹 _Usage_
You can chat with me directly (@pointless_snel_bot) or add me to your group.
